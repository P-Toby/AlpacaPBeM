# AlpacaPBeM for Dominions 5

Alpaca is a small PBeM manager written in C# for Dominions 5 for Windows. It is very early and it is only capable of receiving a turn based on the name of the game and sending turns to a server.
There is no UI at the moment and the user has to fill out the configuration file manually before starting the program. There will hopefully be a UI further down the line.
I'm primarily a C/C++ programmer and this is my first C# program so it is bound to have some spaghetti so any feedback and suggestions are welcome.
